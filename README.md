# 🌤️ AtmosX

AtmosX is a modern, responsive weather dashboard that provides accurate real-time weather information with a clean glassmorphism UI.

### 🧪 Previous Version

- Responsive glassmorphism UI

## ✨ Features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (modular stylesheets)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API

## ⚙️ How It Works

AtmosX fetches weather and forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API.  
All timestamps are processed using the city’s timezone offset, ensuring accurate local times regardless of the user’s device timezone.
